# printf
int printf ( const char * format, ... ); This is the first group project that we have at ALX, which consists of replicating the printf (3) function of language c, calling it _printf.

This function is part of the standard library and to use it we must specify the header file <stdio.h>.

Writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout). If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with %), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.
